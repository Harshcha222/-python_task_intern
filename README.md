# Python Assignment Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python tasks that focus on basic, intermediate, and advanced problem-solving skills. Each task includes a description of the problem and the objective it aims to achieve.

## Task Set 1: Basic Python Logic and Syntax

### Task 1: FizzBuzz
- **Problem:** Write a function `fizz_buzz(n)` that prints the numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number; for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
- **Objective:** Tests basic loops, conditionals, and function definitions.

### Task 2: Palindrome Checker
- **Problem:** Write a function `is_palindrome(s)` that checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome.
- **Objective:** Tests string manipulation skills and basic logic.

### Task 3: Factorial Calculation
- **Problem:** Write a function `factorial(n)` that returns the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`.
- **Objective:** Tests recursive and/or iterative loops and mathematical thinking.

## Task Set 2: Intermediate Problem Solving

### Task 4: Fibonacci Sequence
- **Problem:** Write a function `fibonacci(n)` that returns the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Objective:** Tests recursion, memoization, or iteration techniques.

### Task 5: Anagram Checker
- **Problem:** Write a function `is_anagram(str1, str2)` that checks if two strings are anagrams.
- **Objective:** Tests string manipulation and sorting algorithms.

### Task 6: Find the Missing Number
- **Problem:** Write a function `find_missing(arr, n)` to find the missing number from a list of n-1 integers.
- **Objective:** Tests array manipulation and basic math.

## Task Set 3: Advanced Problem Solving

### Task 7: Reverse a Linked List
- **Problem:** Write a Python class that represents a singly linked list and a function to reverse the list.
- **Objective:** Tests understanding of data structures, classes, and pointer manipulation.

### Task 8: Sorting Algorithm
- **Problem:** Implement any sorting algorithm from scratch (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort).
- **Objective:** Tests understanding of algorithms, efficiency, and time complexity.

### Task 9: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- **Problem:** Write a function `longest_unique_substring(s)` that returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
- **Objective:** Tests string manipulation and efficiency.

## Task Set 4: Real-World Problem Solving

### Task 10: Simple To-Do List Application
- **Problem:** Create a command-line Python application for task management.
- **Objective:** Tests object-oriented programming and basic user interface interaction.

### Task 11: File Processing
- **Problem:** Write a function `process_log_file(filename)` that counts the number of lines containing a specific keyword (e.g., "ERROR") in a log file.
- **Objective:** Tests file handling and efficiency.

### Task 12: API Data Fetching
- **Problem:** Write a Python script to fetch data from an open API (e.g., weather) and display it.
- **Objective:** Tests working with APIs and JSON data parsing.
